# README OVERVIEW

|         |               |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Author  | Logan Stundal |
| Date    | July 26, 2021 |  
| Purpose | This document explains the order-of-operations in which to execute scripts that replicate all analysis in the paper / appendix as well as produce all figures and tables. Additionally, data imports and data exports are noted for each script. All imported and exported data files are stored in the **Replication/Data/** directory. |

These replication files are also located on the [Harvard Dataverse](here.com).

# Software
The primary analysis in this paper was conducted using R-INLA version 21.02.23 
compiled on Feb 22, 2021. The tar.gz files for this version of INLA are 
provided here:  
  - https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable/src/contrib/

# Data

The *Replication/Data/data.Rdata* file contains all data necessary to replicate the analysis. This file contains an r-object called `dat` which is a named list comprising of 4 data frames: `2002-2004`, `2005-2007`, `2008-2009`, and `2002-2009` each corresponding to a temporal aggregation of the data implied by the name. These data frames each contain the following variables:

| Variable Name         | Description                                                             |

# Scripts

| Script Name  | **replication-models.R** |
| :----------- | :----------- |
